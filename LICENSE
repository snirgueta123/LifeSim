### Explanation of Updates:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - This section outlines the three main rules for the game: birth, survival, and death, explaining how they are applied to cells based on the number of live neighbors.

2. **Example Input/Output**:
   - This section provides examples of the initial setup and how the grid evolves after each "Next Generation" action, including how cells come to life or die based on the rules.

With these updates, your `README.md` provides users with a clearer understanding of the rules and example behavior of the program.
